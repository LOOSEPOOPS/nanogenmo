After searching for days or even months \
I finally find it reclining lazily \
[above the peaks][] above the city as if to ask \
Did you miss me?  Yes very much I reply \
and rush to embrace it but it smiles \
and recoils and tells me No no you \
have to try harder than that it says \
I do not give myself up so easily

I try a different tack \
I sing to it bring it flowers nightly \
I compare its eyes to the morning dew \
it has not seen the morning dew \
I say its mouth is the sunset over mountains \
it knows mountains but the sunset \
is only a rumor from the Evening Star \
I tell the Big Dipper that it moves \
[like a quiet river across the earth][]

Rivers I have seen says the Big Dipper \
they sparkle in the light from my stars \
Your stars like eyes I say and it smiles \
[No it says that is too easy][] \
It turns its back \
it walks home along the back of the mountain
