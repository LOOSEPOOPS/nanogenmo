| I was away on vacation when I heard---
| someone sat at my desk while I was away.
| They took my pen, while I was taking
| surf lessons, and wrote the sun into the sky.
| They pre-approved the earth and the waters,
| and all of the living things, without even
| having the decency to text me.  It was not I
| who was behind the phrase "creeping things."
| When I got back, of course I was pissed,
| but it was [already written][] into the policy.
| I'm just saying: don't blame me for Cain
| killing Abel.  That was a murder.  I'm not a cop.
| The Tower of Babel fell on its own.  The ark
| never saw a single drop of rain.  I'm [the drunk][]
| sitting on the curb who just pissed his pants,
| holding up a sign asking where I am.
