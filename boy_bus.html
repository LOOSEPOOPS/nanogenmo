    <section class="thing verse">
    <p>When he said <a href="mountain.html">Bible</a> I heard his southern accent<br />and he had a face I expect all pastors must have<br />a round open honest face<br />that will always be a boy’s face<br />though its owner may rightly call himself a man<br />near my age though I hardly call myself a man</p>
    <p>I have seen this face before whether in life or a dream<br />I can’t tell<br />I might’ve seen him on the street once<br />twice who knows and his pastor’s <a href="moon-drowning.html">moon face</a><br />reminds me of something<br />some distant light my life used to own</p>
    <p><a href="in-bed.html">One night on my birthday the moon was so strong it cast shadows</a><br />I could see to the far hill and back it was all clear to me</p>
    <p>The moon hasn’t done that in a long time<br /><a href="moongone.html">its face has been obscured by clouds</a> for weeks<br />and that boy on the bus his face I’ve forgotten<br />I thought I recognized a good number of people<br />on that bus who I didn’t know at all</p>
