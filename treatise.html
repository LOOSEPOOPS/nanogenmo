    ACTION FROM A DISTANCE&quot;
    
    There is this thing called &quot;spooky
    action at a distance.&quot;  Einstein
    mentioned it first I believe.  It
    is about how two electrons can act
    like they are right next to each
    other although they are very far
    away (lightyears even).  For a long
    time this puzzled scientists until
    someone (not Einstein) figured out
    that maybe the universe is a
    hologram or projection.  So what
    appears to be very far apart in
    the hologram might actually be
    very close in the substrate
    reality.
        I want to talk about this
    effect in literature.  In literature
    the writer writes words on a
    substrate (paper) and later the
    reader reads the same words off
    the substrate.  Although the writer
    and reader might be very far apart
    from each other in time and space,
    they experience the same effect
    from reading the words.  Even the
    writer reading his own words after
    he has written them becomes a
    reader and feels who he was at
    that time, like a ghost.
    
    PROBLEMS:
        Maybe the substrate isn&#39;t
    paper it&#39;s what the writing is
    about.  Where is the hologram?  Are
    physics and literature comparable?
    What if the universe isn&#39;t a
    hologram what then?</code></pre>
