    <p>TREATISE ON LITERATURE AS “SPOOKY ACTION FROM A DISTANCE”</p>
    <p>There is this thing called “spooky action at a distance.” Einstein mentioned it first I believe. It is about how two electrons can act like they are right next to each other although they are very far away (lightyears even). For a long time this puzzled scientists until someone (not Einstein) figured out that maybe the universe is a hologram or projection. So what appears to be very far apart in the hologram might actually be very close in the substrate reality.</p>
    <p>I want to talk about this effect in literature. In literature the writer writes words on a substrate (paper) and later the reader reads the same words off the substrate. Although the writer and reader might be very far apart from each other in time and space, they experience the same effect from reading the words. Even the writer reading his own words after he has written them becomes a reader and feels who he was at that time, <a href="howtoread.html">like a ghost</a>.</p>
    <p>PROBLEMS:</p>
    <p>Maybe the substrate isn’t paper it’s what the writing is about. <a href="toilet.html">Where is the hologram</a>? Are physics and literature comparable? What if the universe isn’t a hologram what then?</p>
