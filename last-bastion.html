<p><span class="line">Dimly remembered celebrity chefs shuffle</span><span class="line">down the cold and darkened highways of the heart.</span><span class="line">They are the last personality left. They are the meek</span><span class="line"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/5-5.htm">who inherited the heart</a>, what was left of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="line">Without food to cook in new or exciting ways</span><span class="line">nor audience to gasp and cackle, the chefs</span><span class="line">of the heart quietly waste away while staring</span><span class="line">doe-eyed into now-empty Safeway windows</span><span class="line">checking under the dusty produce shelves</span><span class="line">for something they pray the <a href="in-bed.html">rats</a> haven’t found yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="line">Years ago, the economy of the heart boomed</span><span class="line">and there was food everywhere. Produce</span><span class="line">piled high in pyramids of devotion, meat in</span><span class="line">gilded glass cases opulent under fluorescence,</span><span class="line">dairy which ran like the <a href="music-433.html">mythical river</a> toward</span><span class="line">cereals hot and cold. Under it all, thrumming</span><span class="line">like great stone wheels on sand under a hot sun</span><span class="line">near a river where reeds sang in the wind</span><span class="line">the heart produced and gave reward for hard labor.</span></p>
<p><span class="line">No one knows when it all ended. No one can say</span><span class="line">if it was the heart that dried up or the heart’s supply.</span><span class="line">Either way, food of the heart became scarcer and scarcer.</span><span class="line">People began dying, not of starvation</span><span class="line">but of a certain facial expression that could only</span><span class="line">be described as desperation. Now</span><span class="line">all that are left are the celebrity chefs, last bastion</span><span class="line">of a once mighty empire of the heart</span><span class="line"><a href="sense-of-it.html">are reduced to husks</a> blown dry by wind.</span></p>
