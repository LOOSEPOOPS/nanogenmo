| What secrets does it hold?
| Can it tell us who kissed Sara
| that night on the veranda, or
| who Joey is really in love with?
| We all know it isn't Sara, we
| mean look at them Christmas eve
| and he's staring whistfully
| at the stars, or the largest
| asteroid in the asteroid belt.
| She's staring at him, sure, but
| she sees the twinkle in his eye
| is not aimed in her direction.
| The reflection of that reflection
| will beam into space, lightyears
| of space, dimming slowly each
| second, until it dies out like
| all of Sara's hopes for something
| resembling love in this life, real
| love that takes hold of her by
| the throat and refuses to let go,
| love that makes men travel for her
| and only for her, love that launches
| space ships to that asteroid, the
| largest in the asteroid belt, that
| jewel of dead rock and ice, harboring
| something that could've been life
| [and nothing that actually is][].
