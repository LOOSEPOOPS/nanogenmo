i
asked
her
and
i
never
got
an
answer
because
at
the
moment
she
disappeared
in
a
puff
of
smoke

like
to
think
nothing
ever
happened
to
her
save
that
she
went
over
to

look
here
at
this
old
place
where
nothing
changes

look
at
the
people
who
pass
by
look
at
the
trees
the
flowers
full
of
wanting
look
how
full
they
are
with
color
look
how
they
mock
us
empty
people

must
fill
themselves
with

emptiness
there
is
nothing
to
be
but
happy
there
is
no
sadness
to
fall
down
like
cherry
petals
the
trees
don't
under
stand
trees
they
are
too
tall
to
see
the
germ
of
discontent
