lost
things
have
a
way
of
staying
lost
they
have
to
want
to
be
found
is
that
why
we
tack
up
signs
hang
socks
from
hooks
in
the
park
have
a
box
for
what's
been
lost
but
now
is
found
maybe
the
lost
want
to
be
found
but
we're
looking
in
the
wrong
places
maybe
we
speak
the
wrong
language
the
language
of
the
found
to
call
to
them
maybe
we
should
try
another
door
