walking
in
the
rain
i
can
walk
through
the
rain
that
rare
occurrence
and
never
be
hit
by
a
drop
there
is
a
space
around
me
that
refuses
to
be
penetrated
by
weather
of
any
kind
be
it
rain
or
snow
or
sunshine
is
it
cold
i
hear
you
asking
in
your
voice
soft
as
a
breeze
no
it
is
not
particularly
cold
if
i
were
to
describe
it
as
warm
i
would
be
lying
as
well
if
i
were
to
pretend
i
heard
you
far-off
mirage
breeze
on
the
horizon
no
truth
would
ever
be
said
to
have
come
from
my
frozen
lips
