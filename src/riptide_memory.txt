Inside of my memory, the poem is another memory.
The air up here is thin, but the wind blows harder
than anywhere else I know.  It threatens to rip
my body away, like an angel of death, to the stars.

In Arizona, I thought I would forget the rain,
forget its sound on a roof like a hard wind, forget
its smell like a far away ocean. Luckily for me
it rains here. Luckily because I forget too easily.
