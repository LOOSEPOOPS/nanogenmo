Silence lies underneath us all in the same way \
[the Nile has a river underneath ten times as large][nile] \
(although this is an urban legend, apparently).

So underneath [truth][] or legend, flowing by \
the feel of their own [silence][], move the stars: \
silence lies underneath us all in the same way.

[John Cage][433], I think, understood this: the way \
that, in a silent room, one still hears the nerves \
(although this is an urban legend, apparently),

or the heart, which I find more easily \
believable: there simply is no way that, by and large, \
silence lies underneath us all in the same way.

There must be different silences, because we \
have different [songs][] to drown them out, different gods \
(although these are urban legends, apparently).

But is not all [sound one sound][]?  You and I \
are two faces to the same head, the same body.  \
Silence lies underneath us all in the same way--- \
although this is an urban legend, apparently.
