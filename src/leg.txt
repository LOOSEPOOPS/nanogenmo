His first chair was a stool.
It was an [uneven wobbly stool][] that would not support even forty pounds.
"So my first chair is a broken stool" he said after nearly breaking his tailbone on the dirt floor.
"Maybe I should start again but this time only with legs."
He began again but this time only with legs.
He built [one leg][], which means he cut a straight piece of wood down to four feet in length, whittled the bark off, and sanded it down smooth in what he was now calling his Woodworking Shack.
He typed up a note on how to make chair legs.

After he tried remembered tried standing the leg up, failing, and after much thought realizing that the ends needed to be flat, he typed one more line on his notecard:

> 5. make ends flat

He had no tools with which to flatten the ends of his leg.
