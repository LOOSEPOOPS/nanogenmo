January. \
It's cold, and I don't like it. \
I prefer warm weather, \
although I like sweaters. They are the one \
warm spot in an otherwise shitty season. \
But fall is better sweater weather. So be patient,

Patient, \
while waiting for the end of January. \
A change of season \
brings a change of mood along with it, \
although I never thought I'd be one \
to believe that SAD junk about effects of weather---

weather!--- \
on a person. Who becomes a patient \
just because of one \
month of snow? I did say of January: \
"It's cold, and I don't like it," \
but I hardly think it's fair, knocking whole seasons,

seasoning \
your conversation with demands for better weather. \
(While I find it \
nearly impossible, it's my mission to be patient \
while waiting for the end of January.) \
Oh, but how the long nights do so tax one!

One \
warm spot in an otherwise shitty season--- \
all I ask, January, \
is one warm day. Do you care whether \
I'm a person who becomes a patient \
in some psych ward? This just about does it.

I.T., \
although I never thought I'd call one, \
is fair and patient \
when I call. They talk with me, season \
my conversation of demands for better weather \
with an argument for the white beauty of January.

They know it's hard; they say each season \
has its detractors. One day, they say, the weather \
will be controlled---until then, patience in January.
