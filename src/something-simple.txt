in mammals the ratio between bladder size \
and urethra is such that it takes \
all of them the same time to piss.  Take \
for example the fact that Fibonnacci \
numbers show up everywhere.  How can you \
look at this at all of this all of \
these facts and tell me to my face there \
is no God?  And yet there isn't \
you murmer quietly into my ear over \
and over like a low tide sounding \
its lonely waves on an abandoned beach.  \
The ocean that birthed us holds us \
still.  We are tied, you and I, together \
in her arms.  The [moon, caring father,][moon] \
looks down from a dispassionate sky.
