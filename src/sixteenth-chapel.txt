If Justin Bieber isn't going for the sixteenth \
chapel, I'm not either.  I admit he is my role \
model.  He's so current, so fresh and so new, \
and Michelangelo is so old, his art so dated.  \
Where is the love in those old paintings?  All \
I see is [creation][], [judgment][], and [death][]---

and I don't get the preoccupation with death.  \
I'm about life!  Ever since my sixteenth \
birthday, when me and my two sisters all \
nearly died when the car I was driving rolled \
into a creek.  Even though I've [forgotten the date][], \
I think it keeps me thinking on the new,

something Biebs would be proud of if he knew.  \
I look at him, and see the [opposite of death][] \
in his eyes, his youthful smile: though someday \
he may [be a father][], and later host a Sweet Sixteen \
for his daughter (who I know he'll buy a Rolls), \
death will never find him.  Living will be all

he'll ever do, because it will be all \
he'll ever need to do.  He is the eternal new, \
the [forever youth:][] this is the simple [role][] \
of every celebrity, to let us forget death.  \
Bieber didn't make a mistake on the Sistine \
Chapel's name.  He merely showed that someday

all old names must go, that on some day \
a name must die so that the thing, which is all \
that matters, can stay as it was in the sixteenth \
century: fresh, ostentatious, and brand new.  \
In a way, [the name becomes a Christ][], experiencing death \
so the world doesn't have to.  But I am wary of this role

for a name.  It seems a name gives meaning, rolls \
the general idea together with the concrete, daily \
toil of the mundane.  Are not life and death \
intertwined?  Is not everything tied up all \
with everything?  I guess I'm saying the new \
necessarily comes from the old, as every sixteen-

year-old has a parent.  [Life rolls to death][], and all \
is tied together.  Each day is born of night, and dies so new \
morning can occur.  Even the sixteenth chapel holds death.
