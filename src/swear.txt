EVERYTHING CHANGES OR EVERYTHING
STAYS THE SAME

First, a history: I was writing my
thoughts in a book.  I got a typewriter
and typing things in a book
became impossible.  I began typing
on 4x6 notecards.  I ran out of
ribbon in my typewriter.  I wrote
on the 4x6 notecards.  I bought a
new ribbon and new notecards.  Now
again I am typing on notecards.
    What have I been typing?
Thoughts, impressions maybe, a log
of changes to my mental state.  I
waited long enough and I began
recording them in the same way.  If
I wait longer the ribbon will run
out again and I'll write again, on
notecards or in my book.  The same
thoughts in different bodies.
    That's what it means, "Every
thing changes or everything stays
the same."  It might as well be
"and."  Local differences add up to
global identities.  It's a hoop,
right?  And we keep going around
and we think it's flat but it's
round like the Earth.

Paul pushed his chair away from the Writing Desk and stared at the notecard.
He stood up, knocked his head on the lightbulb, swore.
He pulled the notecard from his typewriter and crumpled it up with his left hand.
With his right hand he reached in his pocket and pulled out his cigarettes.
He put one in his mouth, threw the paper in the corner, grabbed his axe, went out into the woods.
