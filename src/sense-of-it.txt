I only write poems on the bus anymore.  \
I sit far in the back to be alone.  \
I mark black things on white things in a black thing.  \
I try to make sense of it.

Every time I see a plastic bag in the wind I think: \
This is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.  \
Most of my life I relate to something on the TV: \
This is how I try to make sense of it.

The Talking Heads song ["Stop Making Sense"][stop] \
is about a girlfriend caught cheating and willed oblivion.  \
The song's real title is "Girlfriend is Better" \
but lying about it is a way I try to make sense of it.

The day after I lost her I found you again.  \
Your face made a plastic bag of my heart.  \
Your eyes were the wind pushing the bus forward.  \
I couldn't make sense of it.
