I'm writing this now because I have to.  \
Not in some "my soul yearns for this and \
I can't help it" way, but in the way that this \
moment is structured as such, that it is \
crystallized this way, me writing this, and later \
you reading it, now for you, later for me,

and this tenuous connection mates me \
and you forever, combined with each other, two \
[electrons momentarily entwined][].  Later, \
when I'm dead or far too famous for you, and \
you're in school, reading my words because it is \
required reading, I want you to remember this

connection we've always had, this \
[spider's thread][] hanging between you and me.  \
Which of us is the spider and which is \
the fly still remains to be seen.  To \
eat, perchance to fly: all of that and \
more.  We can settle all of this later.

Yes, it is you I'm thinking of in your later \
time: you specifically, not another.  This \
is true for all $x$ such that $x > 0$ and \
$x$ is a real person, though it doesn't bother me \
to write to a fictional figure or to \
[a figment][], maybe, of my imagination.  This is

what you are right now, anyway, [dear Reader][], is \
it not?  I'm talking about my now, of course, not later, \
which is your now.  Later will be my now too, \
and maybe I'm ultimately writing to a future part of this \
self: you could very well be me.  \
In fact, you probably are me, [some other version][], and

I am you in the past, or what you could've been, and \
at the same time, this isn't true.  Everything is, \
and nothing isn't.  The difference between "you" and "me" \
is in name only.  Maybe you'll get this later, \
[when you're older][], when I'm older, when all of this \
is something we'll look fondly back to,

because I do hope to meet you, although much later, \
and I hope your feeling is the same.  All this \
talk on me and you and you and me we'll keep between us two.
