Paul was writing in his diary about art.

_[This is my brain][]_ he wrote.
_This is my brain and all it contains.
['I contain multitudes' said Legion.][]
I think it was Legion._
The big heading he had written at the top of the page (_ART_ it read, but only when looking at it from his point of view) sat cold and alone, neglected in the [white space][] surrounding it.
He noticed this presently (but not after he had written a little more about multitudes), paused, frowned, and began to write again.

_ART stands alone at the top of a blank page_ he wrote.
_It follows ~~itself in circles~~ its own footprints in a circle around its own name.
It leads nowhere but is present everywhere.
~~It contains~~ It contains multitudes.
Every painting ever made is a painting of every other painting.
Every song is a remix, a [cover version][]._
He crossed out the part about songs for getting off topic.
He made a note to himself in the margin---_Music is not ART._
