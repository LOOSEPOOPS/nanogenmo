![TODO]

When I think of death I think \
of Peter Falk in _The Princess Bride_ patting \
his pockets as he leaves the room

Life is a series of doors or so \
they say but I ask them this \
where does that last door lead?

For Falk maybe it leads backstage \
a black-walled catered affair with stage \
lights slowly baking stale muffins

Sweaty cheese leaking onto dried-out \
grapes a chocolate fountain clogged \
by some errant strawberry crown

but this is not where it leads for you or \
for me that door opens onto darkness marked \
only by a trellis or the lid of a casket

the door of the earth's womb opening \
finally to accept us and with us the dirt \
not to grow more strawberries for Falk

but to pad his feet as he walks overhead \
to visit someone he certainly cares about \
but whose name is lost to posterity.
