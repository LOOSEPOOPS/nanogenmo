It was a [gamble][] \
I lost---thought I could get closer \
than the library, stayed \
on past the admin building, \
back down the hill to my beginning, \
the driver's second-to-last stop. \
[I have to walk now][], \
through the wind and sun, past \
[traffic][] moving merrily along \
taking their own gambles \
staying on or getting off \
too soon.
