And you were there in the start of it all \
and you folded your hands like little doves \
that would fly away like an afterthought \
and you turned to me the window light on your face \
and you asked me something that I did not recognize \
like a great throng of people who are not you \
and I asked are we in a [church][] \
and you answered with the look on your face \
of someone [grieving something gone][] for years \
 but that they had been reminded of \
by a catch in the light or in someone's voice \
and I think maybe it could have been mine \
and I looked away thickly my head was in jelly \
and I didn't get an answer from you but I got one

I looked at the man in front of us with glasses \
he was speaking and holding a book \
and I didn't understand him he was far away \
and I could tell I was missing something important \
and you nodded to yourself at something he said
