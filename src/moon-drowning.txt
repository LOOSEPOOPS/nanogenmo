[The moon is drowning][] the stars it pushes them \
under into the darkness they cannot breathe \
they are flailing the moon boasts to my shadow \
how powerful is the moon how great its light

My shadow nods and calls the moon father though \
it acknowledges also the existence of others \
headlights are like little moons father my shadow says \
they pass like waves in a dark ocean

Father moon becomes angry and threatens \
I can maroon you shadow I can trap you in darkness \
your strength comes from my own the little moons \
are fleeting like foam on a darkened sea

My shadow fears the night as it fears death \
but it remembers the moon's strength is from another \
my shadow wants the headlights like an ocean \
might want the moon as a seducer as a lover
