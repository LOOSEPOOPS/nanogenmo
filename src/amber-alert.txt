Lost things have a way of staying lost.
They have to want to be found---is that why we tack up signs, hang socks from hooks in the park, have a box for what's been lost but now is found?
Maybe the lost *want* to be found but we're looking in the wrong places.
Maybe we speak the wrong language, the language of the found, to call to them.
Maybe we should try another door.
