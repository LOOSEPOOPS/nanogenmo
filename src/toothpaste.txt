He couldn't find a shirt to go to work in.  They all had stains on them
somewhere.  He pulled out a vest to put on over the stains but somehow all of
them were still visible.  Most of them were unidentifiable but one he thought
could have come from that peach he ate two weeks before.  Another looked like
toothpaste but he was paranoid it was something else.

When he took the bus into work he couldn't relax.  He was paranoid everyone
was staring at his stain and kept looking out the corners of his eyes to make
sure they weren't.  They didn't seem to be but they could also be looking away
just as he looked at them.  "The Observation Paradox" he muttered to himself.

Jill was the only one to notice the stain at work.  She came around to his
cubicle during a break because he dared not show his stain in the break room.
"You have a stain on your shoulder" she said "it looks like toothpaste."  "Do
I" he feigned ignorance but went red at the same time "I didn't see that there
this morning."  "How do you get toothpaste on your shoulder?"  "I don't know
skills I guess" he said and she grinned.  "You know vinegar will take that
out" she said "although I think I like it.  You should start a museum of shirt
stains!"  "I don't have that many shirts with stains" he said frowning.  "Yes
you do" she said.
