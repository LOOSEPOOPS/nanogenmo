Nothing is ever over; nothing \
is ever even begun.  The foundation \
hasn't been laid; how can we hope \
to put in the plumbing?  The bed \
is unmade, not even made; the wood \
hasn't been cleft from the tree; \
the seed hasn't been cast \
out of water and growth and sun, \
which itself hasn't started shining.  \
The cock has never stopped crowing \
because he never started.  Peter \
betrays us again and again with \
silence.  Christ wakes up at night, \
choking from a bad dream, wrists \
aching from a dreamt, torturous pain.
