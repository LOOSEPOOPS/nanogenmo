So two hyperintelligent pandimensional beings \
walk into a bar.  One turns to the other and says, \
"Did you remember to check the end state \
of that simulation we were running?"  The other \
says, "No, I thought that you did?"  To which \
the first replies, "[Oh shit][], we missed it.  \
I suppose we must do all of this again.  Barkeep,

two beers please."  The bartender nods in that way \
that bartenders do, pours the two beers, \
expertly, by the way, just so, and hands them \
to the first [hyperintelligent pandimensional][] being.  \
The second one pulls a few singles out of his \
wallet, places them on the bar, and the pair \
turn around and begin walking toward a table \
in the middle of the mostly-empty bar.  The bar- \
tender picks up the money, fans it out, frowns, \
and calls to his patrons' backs: "Hey, this \
isn't enough!"  The two turn around simultan- \
eously, with parity, and stare at him.  A beat.

One of them, the one without the beer, breaks \
the silence by exclaiming, "Oh dear god, I'm \
sorry!  I didn't know your prices went up since \
last time.  What do I owe you?"  The bartender \
says, "Oh, just another [dollar][]-fifty."  The being \
reaches in his back pocket, slides out his \
wallet, looks in smiling, and frowns when he sees \
it's empty.  He looks to the other and says, \
"You got a [buck][]-fifty I can borrow?"

The second hyperintelligent pandimensional being \
considers this.  He sets the beers down \
on the table, pulls out his own wallet, opens \
it, and frowns.  "I'm broke too," he says.
