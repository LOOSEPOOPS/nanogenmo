I thought I saw you walking \
to the bus stop but it was only \
a [raven][].  His croaks sounded nothing \
like your footsteps (as they pound \
down the hallway toward my bedroom) \
his [wings][] looked nothing like your \
legs (running on the wrong side \
of the road away from my house) \
I think the one resemblance was the eyes

But that's too easy \
It's just that I was thinking \
of you and a raven flew by \
(maybe it was a [crow][])
