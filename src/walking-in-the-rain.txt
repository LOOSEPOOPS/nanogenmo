I can walk through the rain, [that rare occurrence][] \
and never be hit by a drop.  There is a space around me \
that refuses to be [penetrated][] by weather of any kind \
be it rain or snow or sunshine.  [Is it cold I hear you][] \
asking in your voice soft as a breeze.  No it is not \
[particularly cold][].  If I were to describe it as warm \
[I would be lying as well][].  If I were to pretend I heard \
you, far-off, mirage, breeze on the horizon, [no truth][] \
would ever be said to have come from [my frozen lips][].
