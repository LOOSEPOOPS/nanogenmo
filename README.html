<p>The goal in this book, <em>Autocento of the breakfast table</em>, is to explore the workings of revision and recursion through words, both in the head and on paper. It's a hypertextual imagining of how things could have been, in all of their possibilities.</p>

<p>This project uses John MacFarlane's amazing, etc. <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">pandoc</a> for the fun, HTML-writing stuff. Use the <code>compile.sh</code> script to compile the stuff down.</p>
<p><em>Note: you're on Windows right now, so make sure and type <code>bash compile.sh</code> to run the program.</em></p>
<p>At the top of each file, there should be a YAML block that looks something like this:</p>
