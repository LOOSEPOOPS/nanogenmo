Now the ticking clocks scare me.  \
The [empty][] rooms, clock towers, belfries; \
I am terrified by them all.

I really used to enjoy going to church, \
singing in the choir, listening to the sermon.  \
Now the chairs squeal like dying pigs---

It was the boar that did it.  \
[Fifteen feet][] from me that night \
in the grass, rooting for God \
knows what, finding me instead.

I ran, not knowing where or how, \
not looking for his pursuit of me.  \
I ran to God's front door, found \
it locked, found the [house][] empty

with a note saying, "Condemned."
