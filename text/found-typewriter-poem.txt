        [Is he older](http://books.google.com/books?id=ALdlAAAAMAAJ&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=older+than)?  I asked her.
        And I never got an answer, because at the moment she disappeared in a puff of smoke.
        I like to think nothing ever happened to her save that she went over to the spirit realm.
        I usually know better though.

| Look, I say---look here---
| at this old place
| [where nothing changes][old-place].
| Look at the people
| who pass by.  Look at
| the trees.  The flowers
| full of wanting: look
| [how full they are][] with
| color.  Look how they mock
| us, empty people who
| must fill themselves
| with changes---emptiness.

| "[There is nothing][] to be
| but happy.  [There is no][]
| sadness to fall down
| like cherry petals."

| The [trees don't under-
| stand:][trees] they are too
| tall to see the germ
| of discontent in us.
