| And you were there at the start of it all
| and you were there at the end bitter as a [nail][]

| and you folded your [hands like little doves][]
| that flew away like an afterthought

| when you turned to me and the window light
| on your face when you told me and I did not

| recognize you in the throng of those who
| are not you and I asked [are we in a church][church]

| and you answered with the look on your face
| like birds [caught in a snare][] like on a voice

| and I think it might have been my voice
| and I could not do but look away my head

| was not my head anymore or hold my thoughts
| I never did get an answer from you but from

| the [man on the radio][] murmuring all night
| and I couldn't understand him so far away

| and I could tell I was missing something important
| and you nodded to yourself at something he said
