_How astonishing it is that language can almost mean,
 but frightening that it does not quite._
_A word is elegy to what it signifies._

The world is somewhat large and unwieldy.
This is something I think we can all agree on.
And although we may be unwieldy, knocking around semi-anonymously between our work and our families, between eating and sleeping, between the bigness that surrounds us on both sides like a tall hedge wall, we are by no means large.
This is something else we can agree on, if we're honest with ourselves.
