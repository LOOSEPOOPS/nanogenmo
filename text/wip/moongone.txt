The moon is gone and in its place a mirror.
Looking at the night sky, the viewer sees only his own face as viewed from far away, surrounded by a vague landscape of mountains, the plain he's standing on, a river.
He sees he is alone in the wilderness.
He wonders in being alone.

But behind him, the viewer sees a pursuer.
