            <p><span class="line">I’m writing this now because I have to.</span><span class="line">Not in some “my soul yearns for this and</span><span class="line">I can’t help it&quot; way, but in the way that this</span><span class="line">moment is structured as such, that it is</span><span class="line">crystallized this way, me writing this, and later</span><span class="line">you reading it, now for you, later for me,</span></p>
            <p><span class="line">and this tenuous connection mates me</span><span class="line">and you forever, combined with each other, two</span><span class="line"><a href="treatise.html">electrons momentarily entwined</a>. Later,</span><span class="line">when I’m dead or far too famous for you, and</span><span class="line">you’re in school, reading my words because it is</span><span class="line">required reading, I want you to remember this</span></p>
            <p><span class="line">connection we’ve always had, this</span><span class="line"><a href="last-passenger.html">spider’s thread</a> hanging between you and me.</span><span class="line">Which of us is the spider and which is</span><span class="line">the fly still remains to be seen. To</span><span class="line">eat, perchance to fly: all of that and</span><span class="line">more. We can settle all of this later.</span></p>
            <p><span class="line">Yes, it is you I’m thinking of in your later</span><span class="line">time: you specifically, not another. This</span><span class="line">is true for all <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>x</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math> such that <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>&gt;</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x &gt; 0</annotation></semantics></math> and</span><span class="line"><math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>x</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math> is a real person, though it doesn’t bother me</span><span class="line">to write to a fictional figure or to</span><span class="line"><a href="epigraph.html">a figment</a>, maybe, of my imagination. This is</span></p>
            <p><span class="line">what you are right now, anyway, <a href="real-writer.html">dear Reader</a>, is</span><span class="line">it not? I’m talking about my now, of course, not later,</span><span class="line">which is your now. Later will be my now too,</span><span class="line">and maybe I’m ultimately writing to a future part of this</span><span class="line">self: you could very well be me.</span><span class="line">In fact, you probably are me, <a href="elegyforanalternateself.html">some other version</a>, and</span></p>
            <p><span class="line">I am you in the past, or what you could’ve been, and</span><span class="line">at the same time, this isn’t true. Everything is,</span><span class="line">and nothing isn’t. The difference between “you” and “me”</span><span class="line">is in name only. Maybe you’ll get this later,</span><span class="line"><a href="found-typewriter-poem.html">when you’re older</a>, when I’m older, when all of this</span><span class="line">is something we’ll look fondly back to,</span></p>
            <p><span class="line">because I do hope to meet you, although much later,</span><span class="line">and I hope your feeling is the same. All this</span><span class="line">talk on me and you and you and me we’ll keep between us two.</span></p>
