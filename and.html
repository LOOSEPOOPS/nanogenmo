<p><span class="line">And you were there at the start of it all</span><span class="line">and you were there at the end bitter as a <a href="last-passenger.html">nail</a></span></p>
<p><span class="line">and you folded your <a href="cold-wind.html">hands like little doves</a></span><span class="line">that flew away like an afterthought</span></p>
<p><span class="line">when you turned to me and the window light</span><span class="line">on your face when you told me and I did not</span></p>
<p><span class="line">recognize you in the throng of those who</span><span class="line">are not you and I asked <a href="boar.html">are we in a church</a></span></p>
<p><span class="line">and you answered with the look on your face</span><span class="line">like birds <a href="roughgloves.html">caught in a snare</a> like on a voice</span></p>
<p><span class="line">and I think it might have been my voice</span><span class="line">and I could not do but look away my head</span></p>

<p><span class="line">and I could tell I was missing something important</span><span class="line">and you nodded to yourself at something he said</span></p>
