i
thought
i
saw
you
walking
to
the
bus
stop
but
it
was
only
a
raven
his
croaks
sounded
nothing
like
your
footsteps
as
they
pound
down
the
hallway
toward
my
bedroom
his
wings
looked
nothing
like
your
legs
running
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
road
away
from
my
house
i
think
the
one
resemblance
was
the
eyes
but
that's
too
easy
it
is
just
that
i
was
thinking
of
you
and
a
raven
flew
by
maybe
it
was
a
crow
