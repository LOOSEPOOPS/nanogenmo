    <p><em>Apparently typewriters need ribbon. Apparently ribbon is incredibly hard to find anymore because no one uses typewriters. Apparently I am writing my hymns from now on.</em> So he was back to calling his notes “hymns.” He looked up “hymns” in the dictionary. It said that a hymn was “an ode or song of praise or adoration.” Praise or adoration to what? he asked himself. He thought maybe furniture. There was still a lot of notfurniture in what he was again calling his Writing Shack.</p>
    <p>The dictionary also had this to say about “hymn”: that it was possibly related to the old Greek word for “<a href="likingthings.html">weave</a>.” “<a href="roughgloves.html">Weave what</a>” Paul wondered to himself. He wrote this down on a new notecard. <em>Apparently “hymn” means weave somehow. Or it used to. Or its cousin did. What is it weaving? Who is it weaving for? I remember in school we talked about Odysseus and his wife Penelope, who wove a tapestry every day just to take it apart at night. I forget why.</em></p>
    <p><em>Maybe she wove the tapestry for Odysseus. Maybe she wove it for herself. What did she weave it of? <a href="ouroboros_memory.html">Memory</a>, maybe? <a href="in-bed.html">Or dream</a>? I think these words make a kind of tapestry, or at least the thread it will be made of. I will weave a hymn to the gods of Literature, out of fiction. My furniture was a try at weaving, but I am shit at furniture. So writing it is again.</em></p>
    <p>He wrote <em><strong>NOTES FOR A HYMN</strong></em> at the top of this notecard.</p>
