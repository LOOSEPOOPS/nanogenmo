Abraham, Abraham, you are old and cannot hear: \
what if you miss my small voice amongst the creaking \
of your own grief, kill your son unknowing \
of what he will be, and commit Israel to nothing?

Abraham, you must know or hope that [God][] \
will not allow your son to die; you must know \
that this is a test, but then why \
are you so bent on Isaac's destruction?  \
Look at your eyes; there is more than fear \
there.  I see in your eyes desperation, \
a manic passion to do right by your God \
whom you are not able to see or know.

Am I too late?  I [will try][] to stay \
your old hands, the knife clenched \
within them, intent on ending life.

Will you hear my small voice amongst the creaking, \
or will it be the chance bleating of a passing ram?
