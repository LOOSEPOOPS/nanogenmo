        <section class="content verse">
            <p><span class="line">I didn’t write this sestina yesterday.</span><span class="line">It’s the first time I fell behind in my task</span><span class="line">and hopefully, the only time it will.</span><span class="line">This means that today I must write two</span><span class="line">sestinas. If I don’t write them today, I</span><span class="line">will have to write two later down the line.</span></p>
            <p><span class="line">Although I feel I’m slogging through each line</span><span class="line">I think I’m doing better every day,</span><span class="line">though maybe this is wishful thinking: I</span><span class="line">showed my friend my just-completed task</span><span class="line">two days ago (my God, was it two</span><span class="line">entire days? I’ve no idea what I’ll</span></p>
            <p><span class="line">do <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-24.htm">after thirty-nine days</a>. I think I’ll</span><span class="line">feel like <a href="death-zone.html">Inigo Montoya</a>, who’d been in the line</span><span class="line">of revenging for so long, he didn’t know what to</span><span class="line">do with the rest of his life), and he deigned</span><span class="line">to be polite, but I could tell the task</span><span class="line">was hard for him. He told me finally that I</span></p>
            <p><span class="line">had made a noble effort, but that ultimately I</span><span class="line">failed. <a href="question.html">So my question</a>: when will</span><span class="line">I be a decent sestina writer? For this is my task.</span><span class="line">Maybe if I just keep cranking out line after line</span><span class="line">I’ll finally figure it out. Maybe one more day</span><span class="line">or another week will do it, or maybe I’ll need two,</span></p>
            <p><span class="line">or maybe it’ll never happen. Maybe a sestina’s too</span><span class="line">involved, too much <a href="tapestry.html">weaving</a> of words too fine, and I</span><span class="line">will never write a good one, even on my best day,</span><span class="line">even if I employ all my skill and all my will.</span><span class="line">I’m not used to writing poems with thirty-nine lines,</span><span class="line">that must be the problem, must be why this task</span></p>
            <p><span class="line">is Herculean. He only had to finish twelve tasks,</span><span class="line">and I have one less one thousand, five hundred twenty-two,</span><span class="line">and it’s nothing but complaining lines</span><span class="line">about <a href="deathstrumpet.html">how hard it is to be a person</a>. I</span><span class="line">am getting sick of myself with these poems, and will</span><span class="line">soon be loathe to get out of bed every day.</span></p>
            <p><span class="line">But I tasked myself with this, which may be the worst I</span><span class="line">ever do to myself. I thought a poem NaNoWriMo would</span><span class="line">be fun, would line my resume, give me something I could publish someday.</span></p>
