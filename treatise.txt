> TREATISE ON LITERATURE AS "SPOOKY
> ACTION FROM A DISTANCE"
>
> There is this thing called "spooky
> action at a distance."  Einstein
> mentioned it first I believe.  It
> is about how two electrons can act
> like they are right next to each
> other although they are very far
> away (lightyears even).  For a long
> time this puzzled scientists until
> someone (not Einstein) figured out
> that maybe the universe is a
> hologram or projection.  So what
> appears to be very far apart in
> the hologram might actually be
> very close in the substrate
> reality.
>
> I want to talk about this
> effect in literature.  In literature
> the writer writes words on a
> substrate (paper) and later the
> reader reads the same words off
> the substrate.  Although the writer
> and reader might be very far apart
> from each other in time and space,
> they experience the same effect
> from reading the words.  Even the
> writer reading his own words after
> he has written them becomes a
> reader and feels who he was at
> that time, [like a ghost][].
>
> PROBLEMS:
>
> Maybe the substrate isn't
> paper it's what the writing is
> about.  [Where is the hologram][]?  Are
> physics and literature comparable?
> What if the universe isn't a
> hologram what then?
