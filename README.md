# NaNoGenMo 2015

This is my project for 2015's National Novel-Generating Month. It's forked
from my master's thesis _[Autocento of the breakfast table][]_, which is a lot
of poems n' stuff.  I'm using the content of _Autocento_ as a corpus in my
"novel" -- and that's all I know about it right now.  I'll be updating this
README as I go and know more things.

I do know one other thing: I'm going to be working with the idea of _cento_ in
this novel -- since it'll be a cento of my other work.  So there's that.
