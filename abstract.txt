Brief Description
-----------------

_Autocento of the breakfast table_ is my Master's thesis, an inter/hypertextual exploration of the workings of inspiration, revision, and obsession.
I've compiled this work over multiple years, and recently linked it all together to form a (hopefully) more cohesive whole.
To make this easier than collating everything by hand, I've relied on a process that leverages open-source technologies to publish my work onto a web platform.

Things to notice
----------------

Take a look around the site.
See how it's navigable: there are links within each article to other articles and to the wider web, mapping common images, themes, or inspirations;
  there's also navigation links at the bottom of each page:

- The **&phi;** shows you the backlinks to each page.
- The **&loz;** takes you back to the cover of the project, to start over.
- The **&#x221d;** takes you to a random article in the project.
- Some pages also have _previous_ and _next_ links.  These take you to other articles in their original project-order.  It's another way to navigate the page.
