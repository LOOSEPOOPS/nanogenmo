On your desk I set a tangerine:  \
a relic of a [winter][] quickly passing.

I'm reminded, fiercely, of a summer:  \
I watched the [cemetery grass][] on my stomach.

You hate the wind [blowing through buildings][]:  \
the coldness of fire, blister of a mountain stream.

When you broke down that night: your aunt / you  \
never have been / [you shook that night][] /

Seasonal affective disorder is real: you  \
[mutter under your breath on the highway][].

The ant carries an orange peel past a headstone:  \
it carries her nearly as often.

I set a tangerine on your desk:  \
an engagement ring, winter-returned.
