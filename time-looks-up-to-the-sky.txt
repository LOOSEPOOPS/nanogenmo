...

| I wish I'd kissed you when I had the chance.
| Your face hovering there, so near to mine,
| your mouth pursed---what word was it you pronounced?

| When I think about you, [something in my pants][]
| tightens, and my thoughts run, and I realize
| I should've kissed you when I had the chance.

| I want that moment never to be past
| like Keats's lovers on the grecian urn:
| his mouth pursed, her figure turned to pronounce

| her hips in ways that are not feminist.
| But time strolls mildly on, not glancing at my
| wish to kiss you when I had the chance,

| whispered like a [beggar to a prince][]
| outside his palace: time looks up to the sky,
| purses his lips, and hears what I pronounce

| but pays it little mind.  If he would just
| turn back, bend down, and follow my design,
| I would have kissed you when I had the chance,
| as your mouth pursed and you pronounced goodbye.
