            <p>Paul only did his reading on the toilet.</p>
            <p>He read in a magazine that the universe as we know it is actually a hologram, a three-dimensional projection of a lower, two-dimensional, “realer” reality. The article said that this model explains things like quantum entanglement, what it called “spooky action at a distance.”</p>
            <p>After he finished, he ran back out to his Writing Shack and hammered out a Treatise on Literature as Spooky Action. His mind was reeling. He typed out an entire <a href="treatise.html">notecard</a> on the subject.</p>
            <p>He stopped to catch his breath. Reading it over, he realized he was completely wrong. “Paper is made from trees” he thought “and so is furniture.” He had thought that ART and CRAFT were two separate enterprises but he realized in a flash that they were two sides of the same building. Were there other walls?</p>
