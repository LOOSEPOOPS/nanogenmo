_Autocento of the breakfast table_ is a hypertextual exploration
of the clockwork of inspiration, revision, and obsession.
It represents a compilation of most of my writing,
linked together along thematic lines into a sort of whole.
It lives on the web.
Instead of hand-coding all of the HTML files you're reading now,
I've relied on a process that leverages open-source technologies
to publish my work onto a web platform.

The [source files][] are authored in [Vim][]
using an [extended version][] of [Markdown][].
It's compiled into the HTML you're reading,
as well as a few other formats,
with [Pandoc][], a document-conversion tool.
The site is hosted on [Github][] and [Namecheap][].
You can view the repository at <http://github.com/duckwork/autocento>.

I use a [Makefile][] to compile the text source files
into HTML, and to generate a series of [appendices][]
and [other site][] [functionality][]
with the help of a [compilation shell script][].

I use this system because it's fairly simple, extensible, and open.
It's available for anyone to examine, learn from, and use.
See the [license][] for more details.

or submit a [pull request][] or [issue][] on Github.
