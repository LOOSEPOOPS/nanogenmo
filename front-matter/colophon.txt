This website is authored in [Vim][]
using an extended version of John Gruber's [Markdown][] syntax.
It's compiled into HTML and other formats
with John McFarlane's [pandoc][] document-conversion tool.
The site is hosted on [Github][] at <http://github.com/duckwork/autocento>.

The content of this site has been compiled
from a multitude of other projects, including
_[Elegies for alternate selves][elegies]_,
_[The book of Hezekiah][hez]_,
_[Stark raving][stark]_ (later called _Everything changes_),
and _[Buildings out of air][paul]_,
as well as new poems written 2014--2015.

The [appendices][], as well as the HTML itself
and backlink functionality,
are compiled with [this makefile][makefile].
The Javascript that randomizes the &xi; link at the bottom of each page
is located [here][randomizer].

Any questions or accolades can be directed to my [email][].
