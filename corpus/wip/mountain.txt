The other side of the mountain is
not the same mountain.  This side
is stickysweet full of phone calls
where not much was said but promises

to call some other time or visit.
The other side of the mountain is
a bell, ringing in the church to mark
the day we couldn't visit anymore.

The other side of the mountain is
not a mountain.  At the bottom a river
courses past a ferry in the dark.
