| [The radio is screaming the man][]
| on the radio will not be quiet he is
| pushed far into the background
| while some NPR talkers murmur over
| his screaming he lost something
| very important.  He says it over
| and over but they do not listen
| they think of their children at home
| lying [in bed][] dreaming sweet
| childhood one of them is staying over
| at a friend's house they are staying
| up late they never want it to be over
| not like the man.  His life on the radio
| will be the only one he ever has
| his life it is wasted he's being spoken over
| such pain is in his voice.  I wish you
| could hear it.  [It's something never over][].
| Suffering everywhere always and over it
| the same serene murmur of the comfortable
| distracted or worse looking over
| the [shoulder][] and quietly looking away.
