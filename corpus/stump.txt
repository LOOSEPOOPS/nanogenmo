...

He walked into the woods for the first time in months.
It was a bright summer day but under the canopy of leaves it was cool and quiet and twilight.
[There was no sound but his footsteps, his breathing.][]
Instead of an axe, his right hand clutched his notebook.
His left was in his pocket.
A pencil perched behind his ear.

He walked aimlessly until coming over a short rise he saw a stump.
He recognized his handiwork in the way the stump made a kind of chair back---flat until the axe had gone through far enough, then a frayed edge like a torn page.
Paul walked over to the stump and sat down.

He looked up and tried to find a pattern in the placement of the trees.
There was none.
They grew randomly, beginning nowhere and ending in the same place.
[A squirrel][] ran down one and up another for no reason.
He opened his notebook and took his pencil from his ear but could think of nothing to write.

A crow called hoarsely to another, something important.
Paul looked up but could not see the black bird in the [leaves of the trees][].
He looked back down to the cream-colored pages of his notebook.

He was surprised that he'd written _YOU CANNOT DISCOVER ART_.
