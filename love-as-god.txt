| [God is love][], they say, but there [is][]
| no god.  Therefore, how can there be love?
| And if there is no love, how can there be God?
| There are things in life, I suppose,
| that are simply unanswerable mysteries
| of existence.  Maybe this God and love are one.

| Maybe there are many loves, instead of one.
| The difference between [what isn't][] and what is
| could merely be one of scope.  The mystery
| is how we speak only of one love---
| to act as though we know we are supposed
| to love only one other, or that one other and God.

| But supposing that one other is God?
| What then?  Is the God-lover to walk alone,
| supported by God only when He feels He is supposed
| to support her?  What kind of love is
| this?  I would argue in fact this isn't love,
| this [one-set-of-footprints-in-the-sand][] mystery.

| How to define two loves as one is the mystery.
| It's obvious to many there is a thing called God,
| and just as obvious that there is one called love.
| Maybe we fool ourselves, we who can't be alone;
| maybe we don't know what either God or love is.
| Maybe, and perhaps; but I for one propose

| that we as only humans are not supposed
| to know or understand capital-L Life, that mystery.
| Isn't it enough to know that God is
| love, and love is God,
| no matter which one
| does or does not exist?  What is life, if no love,

| if no God?  [Maybe][Maybe1] this saying, "God is love,"
| is less a definition of God what what love is supposed
| to be.  Of these two terms, [maybe2][] the one
| we should capitalize is Love, that great mystery
| of chemistry and longing.  Maybe "Love is god"
| is a more fitting [epigraph][] for what life is

| [made of:][made of] Love, that most delicate, most misty
| of all emotions, is supposed to be their god,
| as the one that binds us, that was, that will be, that is.
