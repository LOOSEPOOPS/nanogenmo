    <section class="verse">
    <p>There is a theory which states the Universe<br />if it began with the same initial conditions<br />( <a href="the-sea_the-beach.html">same gravity</a> same strong weak nuclear force same<br />size and shape ) would unfold in exactly<br />the way it has : with the same planets <a href="big-dipper.html">orbiting suns</a><br />same people making same mistakes : like this morning</p>
    <p>( It’s actually past two but I will call it <a href="plant.html">morning</a> )<br />while turning on the shower : I as the Universe<br />intended ( although I was expecting the heat of suns )<br /><a href="100-lines.html">had the ice of inner space</a> : those pre existing conditions<br />before the Big Bang : the shower was almost exactly<br />freezing for a split second : every day it’s the same :</p>
    <p><a href="hard-game.html">I turn on the tap</a> hop in pull the knob have the same<br />moment of utter panic then pain then a relaxing morning<br />shower where I spend between five to ten ( I’m not sure exactly )<br />minutes : I have good thoughts : <a href="howtoread.html">this poem about the Universe</a><br />for example : I had the idea while I was conditioning<br />my hair : it came to me like accidentally looking at the sun :</p>
    <p>the pain and the wonder that something as large as suns<br />could appear so small and yet so hot all at the same<br />time : so hot in the summer we require air conditioning<br />( although now in the winter it’s cold in the morning )<br />and I can’t wait to hop in the shower that tiny universe<br />of water and steam and soap and <a href="ouroboros_memory.html">body</a> : that and only that exactly</p>
    <p>or rather exclusively ( it’s hard to get the words exactly<br />right : the meanings bleed into each other like the sun’s<br />shadows on pavement ) ready for me to <a href="dream.html">dream</a> another universe<br />into it on top of it again and again until they all look the same :<br />I can’t tell whether it’s my morning or the shower’s morning<br />or where I put the conditioner or what the initial conditions</p>
    <p>could have been that decided I would misplace my conditioner<br />today : and why and how much planning was involved exactly<br />that would cause so far down the production line of this morning<br />: me to <a href="stump.html">wake up so long after the rising</a> of the sun<br />: me to stay inside all day even after showering to look at the same<br /><a href="telemarketer.html">computer screen</a> : to give up the actual universe to the universe</p>
    <p>in there with its conditions : where <a href="reports.html">the screen serves</a> as sickly sun :<br />where there is apparently exactly what I need : no more : the same<br />three sites I visited this morning comprising my entire Universe</p>
