title: 'Dead man'
project: 'Elegies for Alternate Selves'
...

A dead man finds his way into our hearts \
simply by opening the door and walking in. \
He pours himself a drink, speaks aimlessly \
about hunting or some bats he saw \
on the way over, wheeling around each other. \
Look how they spin, he says, it's like the \
ripples atoms make as they hurl past each other \
in the space between their bodies. \
We mention the eels at the aquarium, how \
their bodies knot while mating. The dead man \
was a boyscout once, and tied a lot of knots. \
His favorite was the one with the rabbit \
and the hole, and the rabbit going in and out \
and around the tree. The dead man liked it \
because he liked to pretend that the rabbit \
was running from a fox, and the rabbit \
always ended up safe, back in his hole.
