<p>“Do we have any lotion” he asked his mother. “In the medicine cabinet” she said without looking up from the TV. He walked into the <a href="boar.html">bathroom</a> and looked at himself in the mirror. “I look strange” he said to himself “I look like a teenager.” He stared into his <a href="man.html">right eye, then his left</a>. He saw nothing but <a href="deathstrumpet.html">his own reflection fish-eyed</a> in his pupils. He opened the medicine cabinet.</p>

Reach under the skin and pull on the outside tendons– the hand opens again. Hands are only <a href="ex-machina.html">machines</a> for grasping, controlled by the arm, not the mind.</p>
