    <p>“Do we have any lotion” he asked his mother. “In the medicine cabinet” she said without looking up from the TV. He walked into the bathroom and looked at himself in the mirror. “I look strange” he said to himself “I look like a teenager.” He stared into his right eye, then his left. He saw nothing but his own reflection fish-eyed in his pupils. He opened the medicine cabinet.</p>

    them such power?  It is that their
    power is hidden in the arm.  Push

    hand closes.  Reach under the skin
    and pull on the outside tendons--
    the hand opens again.  Hands are
    only machines for grasping,
    controlled by the arm, not the
    mind.</code></pre>
