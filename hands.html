He walked into the <a href="boar.html">bathroom</a> and looked at himself in the mirror. “I look strange” he said to himself “I look like a teenager.” He stared into his <a href="man.html">right eye, then his left</a>. He saw nothing but <a href="deathstrumpet.html">his own reflection fish-eyed</a> in his pupils. He opened the medicine cabinet.</p>
            <p>Back in his Writing Shack, he started to type.</p>

            <p>What is it about hands that gives them such power? It is that their power is hidden in the arm. Push on the inside of the wrist–the hand closes. Reach under the skin and pull on the outside tendons– the hand opens again. Hands are only <a href="ex-machina.html">machines</a> for grasping, controlled by the arm, not the mind.</p>
