There are more modern ideals of beauty \
than yours, young padowan. Jessica has \
some assets, that I'll give you easily, \
but in my women I prefer pizzazz.

I don't want to bring you down, or make you think \
that your perfected woman isn't so. \
It's just that, like Adam said, 2006 \
has come and gone. What did she do

in that year anyway? IMDB \
has, surprisingly, none, though in '05 \
she's in four titles. Sin City \
I've never seen, although from many I've

heard it's good. But it's still irrelevant--- \
no matter how comely, she lacks talent.
