...

| Tonight, as I look up, the stars
| hide themselves in shame.  [There is no moon][].
| The sky is black, like my desk,

| [nothing like a raven][].  The streetlights
| look on the scene disinterested.
| They have their own [small gossips of the dark][].

| I came here to find the Lion, old
| friend, but he will not show his flanks, his
| paws, his shoulders, [his mane][].  I

| can hear him laughing from his hiding-place
| behind the moon, nonexistent, under
| the cold dead earth.  The mountain is in front

| of me now, a hole of stars daring me
| to pierce it with my sight.  The lion's still
| laughing; the streetlamps talk about

| me amongst themselves, and go out.  There
| never was any lion, they tell me.
| [You only hear the wind][] [on the mountain][].
