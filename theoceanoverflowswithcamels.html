The burning bush began crying</span><span class="line">like a child who misses his mother. Traffic</span><span class="line">slammed shut like an eye. God’s mean <a href="roughgloves.html">left hook</a></span><span class="line">knocked us out, and we began swimming.</span><span class="line">Bruises bloomed like algae on a lake.</span><span class="line">Your <a href="angeltoabraham.html">father</a> beat your chest and screamed</span><span class="line">for someone to open a window. The air</span><span class="line">stopped breathing. Fish clogged its gills.</span><span class="line">Birds sang too loudly, trying to drown out</span><span class="line">your father’s cries, but all their sweetness</span><span class="line">was not enough. No polite noises will be made</span><span class="line">anymore, he told us, clawing your breastbone.</span><span class="line">He opened your heart to air again. Camels</span><span class="line">flowed from you both like water from the rock.</span><span class="line">God spoke up, but nobody listened to him.</span><span class="line">We hung you up on the line to dry.</span></p>
