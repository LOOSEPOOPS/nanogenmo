    <section class="thing verse">
    <p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+4%3A8&amp;version=NIV">God is love</a>, they say, but there <a href="i-wanted-to-tell-you-something.html">is</a><br />no god. Therefore, how can there be love?<br />And if there is no love, how can there be God?<br />There are things in life, I suppose,<br />that are simply unanswerable mysteries<br />of existence. Maybe this God and love are one.</p>
    <p>Maybe there are many loves, instead of one.<br />The difference between <a href="largest-asteroid.html">what isn’t</a> and what is<br />could merely be one of scope. The mystery<br />is how we speak only of one love—<br />to act as though we know we are supposed<br />to love only one other, or that one other and God.</p>
    <p>But supposing that one other is God?<br />What then? Is the God-lover to walk alone,<br />supported by God only when He feels He is supposed<br />to support her? What kind of love is<br />this? I would argue in fact this isn’t love,<br />this <a href="http://www.footprints-inthe-sand.com/index.php?page=Poem/Poem.php">one-set-of-footprints-in-the-sand</a> mystery.</p>
    <p>How to define two loves as one is the mystery.<br />It’s obvious to many there is a thing called God,<br />and just as obvious that there is one called love.<br />Maybe we fool ourselves, we who can’t be alone;<br />maybe we don’t know what either God or love is.<br />Maybe, and perhaps; but I for one propose</p>
    <p>that we as only humans are not supposed<br />to know or understand capital-L Life, that mystery.<br />Isn’t it enough to know that God is<br />love, and love is God,<br />no matter which one<br />does or does not exist? What is life, if no love,</p>
    <p>if no God? <a href="cereal.html">Maybe</a> this saying, “God is love,”<br />is less a definition of God what what love is supposed<br />to be. Of these two terms, <a href="death-zone.html">maybe2</a> the one<br />we should capitalize is Love, that great mystery<br />of chemistry and longing. Maybe “Love is god”<br />is a more fitting <a href="epigraph.html">epigraph</a> for what life is</p>
    <p><a href="tapestry.html">made of:</a> Love, that most delicate, most misty<br /> of all emotions, is supposed to be their god,<br />as the one that binds us, that was, that will be, that is.</p>
