            <p><span class="line"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+4%3A8&amp;version=NIV">God is love</a>, they say, but there <a href="i-wanted-to-tell-you-something.html">is</a></span><span class="line">no god. Therefore, how can there be love?</span><span class="line">And if there is no love, how can there be God?</span><span class="line">There are things in life, I suppose,</span><span class="line">that are simply unanswerable mysteries</span><span class="line">of existence. Maybe this God and love are one.</span></p>
            <p><span class="line">Maybe there are many loves, instead of one.</span><span class="line">The difference between <a href="largest-asteroid.html">what isn’t</a> and what is</span><span class="line">could merely be one of scope. The mystery</span><span class="line">is how we speak only of one love—</span><span class="line">to act as though we know we are supposed</span><span class="line">to love only one other, or that one other and God.</span></p>
            <p><span class="line">But supposing that one other is God?</span><span class="line">What then? Is the God-lover to walk alone,</span><span class="line">supported by God only when He feels He is supposed</span><span class="line">to support her? What kind of love is</span><span class="line">this? I would argue in fact this isn’t love,</span><span class="line">this <a href="http://www.footprints-inthe-sand.com/index.php?page=Poem/Poem.php">one-set-of-footprints-in-the-sand</a> mystery.</span></p>
            <p><span class="line">How to define two loves as one is the mystery.</span><span class="line">It’s obvious to many there is a thing called God,</span><span class="line">and just as obvious that there is one called love.</span><span class="line">Maybe we fool ourselves, we who can’t be alone;</span><span class="line">maybe we don’t know what either God or love is.</span><span class="line">Maybe, and perhaps; but I for one propose</span></p>
            <p><span class="line">that we as only humans are not supposed</span><span class="line">to know or understand capital-L Life, that mystery.</span><span class="line">Isn’t it enough to know that God is</span><span class="line">love, and love is God,</span><span class="line">no matter which one</span><span class="line">does or does not exist? What is life, if no love,</span></p>
            <p><span class="line">if no God? <a href="cereal.html">Maybe</a> this saying, “God is love,”</span><span class="line">is less a definition of God what what love is supposed</span><span class="line">to be. Of these two terms, <a href="death-zone.html">maybe2</a> the one</span><span class="line">we should capitalize is Love, that great mystery</span><span class="line">of chemistry and longing. Maybe “Love is god”</span><span class="line">is a more fitting <a href="epigraph.html">epigraph</a> for what life is</span></p>
            <p><span class="line"><a href="tapestry.html">made of:</a> Love, that most delicate, most misty</span><span class="line">of all emotions, is supposed to be their god,</span><span class="line">as the one that binds us, that was, that will be, that is.</span></p>
