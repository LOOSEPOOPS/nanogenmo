<section class="content verse">
<p><span class="line">So two hyperintelligent pandimensional beings</span><span class="line">walk into a bar. One turns to the other and says,</span><span class="line">“Did you remember to check the end state</span><span class="line">of that simulation we were running?&quot; The other</span><span class="line">says, “No, I thought that you did?” To which</span><span class="line">the first replies, “<a href="movingsideways.html">Oh shit</a>, we missed it.</span><span class="line">I suppose we must do all of this again. Barkeep,</span></p>
<p><span class="line">two beers please.&quot; The bartender nods in that way</span><span class="line">that bartenders do, pours the two beers,</span><span class="line">expertly, by the way, just so, and hands them</span><span class="line">to the first <a href="http://hitchhikers.wikia.com/wiki/Mice">hyperintelligent pandimensional</a> being.</span><span class="line">The second one pulls a few singles out of his</span><span class="line">wallet, places them on the bar, and the pair</span><span class="line">turn around and begin walking toward a table</span><span class="line">in the middle of the mostly-empty bar. The bar-</span><span class="line">tender picks up the money, fans it out, frowns,</span><span class="line">and calls to his patrons’ backs: “Hey, this</span><span class="line">isn’t enough!&quot; The two turn around simultan-</span><span class="line">eously, with parity, and stare at him. A beat.</span></p>
<p><span class="line">One of them, the one without the beer, breaks</span><span class="line">the silence by exclaiming, “Oh dear god, I’m</span><span class="line">sorry! I didn’t know your prices went up since</span><span class="line">last time. What do I owe you?&quot; The bartender</span><span class="line">says, “Oh, just another <a href="one-hundred-lines.html">dollar</a>-fifty.” The being</span><span class="line">reaches in his back pocket, slides out his</span><span class="line">wallet, looks in smiling, and frowns when he sees</span><span class="line">it’s empty. He looks to the other and says,</span><span class="line">“You got a <a href="plant.html">buck</a>-fifty I can borrow?”</span></p>
<p><span class="line">The second hyperintelligent pandimensional being</span><span class="line">considers this. He sets the beers down</span><span class="line">on the table, pulls out his own wallet, opens</span><span class="line">it, and frowns. “I’m broke too,” he says.</span></p>
