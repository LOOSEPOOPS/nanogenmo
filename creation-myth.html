    <p>So two hyperintelligent pandimensional beings<br />walk into a bar. One turns to the other and says,<br />“Did you remember to check the end state<br />of that simulation we were running?” The other<br />says, “No, I thought that you did?” To which<br />the first replies, “<a href="movingsideways.html">Oh shit</a>, we missed it.<br />I suppose we must do all of this again. Barkeep,</p>
    <p>two beers please.&quot; The bartender nods in that way<br />that bartenders do, pours the two beers,<br />expertly, by the way, just so, and hands them<br />to the first <a href="http://hitchhikers.wikia.com/wiki/Mice">hyperintelligent pandimensional</a> being.<br />The second one pulls a few singles out of his<br />wallet, places them on the bar, and the pair<br />turn around and begin walking toward a table<br />in the middle of the mostly-empty bar. The bar-<br />tender picks up the money, fans it out, frowns,<br />and calls to his patrons’ backs: “Hey, this<br />isn’t enough!” The two turn around simultan-<br />eously, with parity, and stare at him. A beat.</p>
    <p>One of them, the one without the beer, breaks<br />the silence by exclaiming, “Oh dear god, I’m<br />sorry! I didn’t know your prices went up since<br />last time. What do I owe you?” The bartender<br />says, “Oh, just another <a href="100-lines.html">dollar</a>-fifty.” The being<br />reaches in his back pocket, slides out his<br />wallet, looks in smiling, and frowns when he sees<br />it’s empty. He looks to the other and says,<br />“You got a <a href="plant.html">buck</a>-fifty I can borrow?”</p>
    <p>The second hyperintelligent pandimensional being<br />considers this. He sets the beers down<br />on the table, pulls out his own wallet, opens<br />it, and frowns. “I’m broke too,” he says.</p>
