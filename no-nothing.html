Only there was no</span><span class="line">river: it was noon. You can</span><span class="line">say the sun is a river; you</span><span class="line">can argue the stars back it</span><span class="line">like <a href="lovessong.html">shirts behind a closet</a></span><span class="line">door; you can say <a href="big-dipper.html">the earth</a></span><span class="line">holds us up with its weight</span><span class="line">or that it means well or it</span><span class="line">means anything.</span><span class="line">                There is no</span><span class="line">closet, <a href="amber-alert.html">nor door</a>; there are</span><span class="line">no shirts hanging anywhere.</span><span class="line">There is no false wall that</span><span class="line">leads deep into the earth’s</span><span class="line">bowels, <a href="real-writer.html">growing warmer</a> with</span><span class="line">each step.

Trees</span><span class="line">were the pallbearers at the</span><span class="line">funeral, the train was long</span><span class="line">and wailful, there was much</span><span class="line"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/13-28.htm">wailing and gnashing</a> of all</span><span class="line">teeth–though there were no</span><span class="line">teeth, no train, no funeral</span><span class="line">or prayer or trees at all–</span><span class="line">nor a <a href="howtoread.html">river underneath</a> any-</span><span class="line">thing.

Look around, and</span><span class="line">tell me something that I do</span><span class="line">not know. I know, more than</span><span class="line">anything, that the world is</span><span class="line">always ending.

            <p><span class="line">Nothing somehow still turns</span><span class="line">and flows past us, past all</span><span class="line">time and beyond it, a river</span><span class="line">returning, to its forgotten</span><span class="line">origins deep within itself.</span></p>
