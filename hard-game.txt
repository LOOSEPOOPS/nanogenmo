| You think building Hoggle's a hard game?
| You know bunk.  Writing a ghazal's a hard game.

| Let's meet in a place where words & fabric play---
| but not [plastic][] words.  (Boggle's a hard game.)

| A cookout where we can hash our differences
| over steak, though making it sizzle's a hard game.

| Let's go to a brothel, [rub shoulders][] with bare
| shoulders, or a bar.  Being wastrel's a hard game.

| Maybe we could switch professions, you and I,
| you write the poems, I'll puppet Fozzie---a hard game.

| When you call me, you never say my name.
| Creativity's [a hose][]---shutting the nozzle's the hard game.
