project: 'Elegies for Alternate Selves'
...

My body is attached to your body by a thin spittle of thought.  \
When you turn away from me, my thought is broken \
and forms anew with something else.  Ideas are drool.  \
Beauty has been slobbered over far too long.  [God][] \
is a tidal wave of bodily fluid.  Even the flea has some \
vestigial wetness.  We live in a world fleshy and dark, \
and moist as a nostril.  Is conciousness only a watery-eyed \
romantic, crying softly into his [shirt-sleeve][]?  Is not reason \
a square-jawed businessman with a briefcase full of memory?  \
I want to kiss the world to make it mine.  I want to become \
a Judas to reality, betray it with the wetness of emotion.
