    <p>Say there are no words. Say that we are conjoined<br />from birth, or better still, say we are myself.<br />—But I still talk to myself, I build my world<br />through language, so if we say there are no words<br />this is not enough. Say we are instead some animal,<br />or better yet, a plant, or a flagellum motoring<br />aimlessly around. (Say that humans are the only things<br />that reason. Say that we’re the only things that worry.)</p>
    <p>Say that I am separate. To say there’s everything else<br />and then there’s me is wrong. Each thing is separate:<br />there is no whole in the world. Say this is both good<br />and bad, or rather, say there is no good or bad but only<br />being, more and more of it always added, none taken out<br />though it can be forgotten. Say that forgetting<br />is a function of our remembering. (Say that humans only<br />worry about separation. Say that only humans feel it.)</p>
