        <section class="content prose"><p>“Paul, you can’t turn in your reports on four-by-six notecards” Jill told him after he handed her his reports, typed carefully on twelve four-by-six notecards. He had spent the weekend</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>going to the Office Supply Store to buy notecards and typewriter ribbon (he found it surprisingly easily) after his first payday</li>
<li>replacing the ribbon in his typewriter (this took approximately half an hour, because he had to figure it all out on his own)</li>
<li>opening the package of notecards (this took approximately four seconds, although he still had to figure out how to do it on his own. It was just easier)</li>
<li>carefully typing the reports he’d handwritten on letter paper onto the notecards (he made many mistakes and threw away many notecards, though later he used them for kindling)</li>
</ol>
<p>so understandably he was upset. He told Jill all the work he’d gone to to type those notecard reports for her, for the company. <a href="seasonal-affective-disorder.html">She shook her head.</a> “Paul, you don’t have to do all that work at home. Just type it up on the computers here, that’s all you need to do. Thanks for the work though.” He nodded as she threw the notecards into the trashcan and left his cubicle.</p></section>
