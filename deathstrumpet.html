            <p><span class="line">He stood up and put the horn to his lips, imagining</span><span class="line">it was a woman he loved. He blushed as he realized</span><span class="line">it was a terrible metaphor.</span><span class="line">He practiced for six hours a day—what else to do?</span></p>
            <p><span class="line">Death looks at <a href="moongone.html">himself in the mirror</a> as he plays.</span><span class="line">The trumpet is suspended in midair. Damn vampire rules.</span><span class="line">Death is always worried he might have missed a spot shaving</span><span class="line">but he’ll never know unless a stranger is polite enough.</span><span class="line">Not that he ever goes out or meets anyone.</span></p>
            <p><span class="line">He wakes up late these days. Stays in bed later.</span><span class="line">He thinks he might be depressed. The caprese has gotten soggy</span><span class="line">since he made it, maybe three days ago or maybe just two.</span><span class="line">The sun streams through his kitchen blinds like smoke.</span><span class="line">He decides to go to the arcade. When he gets there,</span></p>
            <p><span class="line">there’s only a <a href="angeltoabraham.html">little boy</a> with dead eyes. So far so good.</span><span class="line">He’s playing a first-person shooter. Death walks past him</span><span class="line">and watches out of the corner of his eye. The kid’s good.</span><span class="line">Death wants to congratulate him. His trumpet is in his hand.</span></p>
