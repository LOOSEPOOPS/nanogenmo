<section class="content verse">
<p><span class="line">He didn’t have any polish so he spit-shined the whole thing</span><span class="line">until it gleamed like a <a href="wallpaper.html">tomato on the vine</a> that was begging</span><span class="line">to be picked and thrown on some caprese. Death loved caprese.</span></p>
<p><span class="line">He stood up to put the horn to his lips, trying to imagine</span><span class="line">it was a woman he loved. He blushed as he realized how bad</span><span class="line"><a href="leaf.html">the metaphor was</a>. He practiced anyway for six hours a day</span><span class="line">in front of the mirror—what else to do with all the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="line">Death looked at <a href="moongone.html">himself in the mirror</a> as he played, the trumpet</span><span class="line">suspended in midair. <em>Damn vampire rules</em>, he thought.</span><span class="line">He was always worried he might have <a href="january.html">missed a spot</a> while shaving</span><span class="line">but he’d never know unless a stranger—he had no friends—</span><span class="line">was kind enough. Not that he goes out anyway or meets people.</span></p>
<p><span class="line">He started waking up late, staying in bed later.</span><span class="line">He started thinking he was depressed. He never did eat</span><span class="line">that caprese, and it started getting soggy, green spots</span><span class="line">spreading on the mozzarella like bedsores. The sun</span><span class="line">filtered through the <a href="what-we-are-made-of.html">kitchen blinds like smoke</a>. He had</span><span class="line">to get out of the house. He decided to go to the arcade.</span></p>
<p><span class="line">When he got there, it was empty except for a boy</span><span class="line"><a href="big-dipper.html">with dead eyes</a>. So far so good, Death thought.</span><span class="line">He was playing a first-person shooter, something violent.</span><span class="line">Death walked past him and watched out of the corner</span><span class="line">of his eye. The kid was good. Death decided</span><span class="line">to congratulate him. He had his trumpet in his hand.</span></p>
