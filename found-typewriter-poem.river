look
i
say
look
here
at
this
old
place
where
nothing
changes
look
at
the
people
who
pass
by
look
at
the
trees
the
flowers
full
of
wanting
look
how
full
they
are
with
color
look
how
they
mock
us
empty
people
who
must
fill
themselves
with
changes
emptiness
there
is
nothing
to
be
but
happy
there
is
no
sadness
to
fall
down
like
cherry
petals
the
trees
do
not
under
stand
they
are
too
tall
to
see
the
germ
of
discontent
in
us
